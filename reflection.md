- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

- Encapsulation makes code easier to manage, but it can be tricky to remember which methods and variables should be public or private.
- The structure of the classes made sense, and I could see how each piece fits together, but I had trouble making sure the classes communicated properly, especially with accessing private variables. I'd say to make sure to break down each part of the code and test classes individually before tying everything together.
